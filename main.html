<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity, meaning it can handle large inputs without taking an excessively long time to run.</p>
<p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. It is often denoted using Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> focuses on how much memory is required by an algorithm to complete its task.</p>
